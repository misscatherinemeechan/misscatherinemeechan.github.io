                <h3> IT in modern business</h3>
                <br>
                <p>The IT industry has been utilised by businesses for many years with the sector being valued at around £180 billion in 2018. The relationship of IT within modern business is ever deepening as we enter into, what has been termed as, the ‘Fourth Industrial Revolution’.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Within the UK, the tech sector has seen an increase in employment of 13.2% between 2014 and 2017 (Tech Nation Report 2018) although there are some hidden underlying issues.  London can compete on a global scale with the likes of Silicon Valley and  New York, being rated third by Startup Genome in 2017, but the industry covers the wider UK. Several pockets of IT communities are starting to become visible outside of the capital and the government has used the future opportunities as a leading argument during the process of leaving the EU through Brexit. </p>
                <br>
                <p>However, access to talent within the UK (the 'Digital Skills Gap') and diversity within the workforce needs to be addressed in order to harness the full potential of the sector.  New technologies are providing faster insights into vast data stores, bringing disruption to labour markets and business models whilst providing new models and economic growth for companies who are pioneers in their field.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The 'Gig Economy' is a solution that is currently being researched to see if this is a sustainable avenue for companies in the future, with current freelancers working across a range of industry types. Consideration is being taken to ensure there is no loss of workers rights and so far the feedback from participants has been positive. When asked if they would prefer to work gigs or return to a more traditional job role, in the UK 30% would prefer to stay in the gig economy for more flexibility in their work/life balance.</p>
